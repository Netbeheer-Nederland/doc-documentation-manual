= Creating a new draft

To make changes you need to create a draft. Drafts are tracked in Git in dedicated branches called _draft branches_. Depending on what major version(s) you are working on, you choose a different _version branch_ footnote:[Each major version has a dedicated branch in Git called a _version branch_. These branches enable simultaneous maintenance on multiple major versions.] to branch off for your draft. If you know in advance the changes will constitute a major version increment, you can create a new version branch beforehand.

[NOTE]
Even though your draft branch will originate from one version branch, it is possible to merge it onto several version branches. This can be useful in scenarios such as fixing a typo that is present in more than one of the major versions.

== Creating a version branch

.New version branch `v1`
====
// Mermaid Gitgraph
////
%%{init: { 'gitGraph': {'mainBranchName': 'v0', 'showBranches': true, 'parallelCommits': false}} }%%
gitGraph
  commit
  commit
  branch v1
  checkout v1
  commit

If you want to create a new version branch, simply create a new branch on the Git repository following the naming scheme `vM`, where `v` stands for 'version' and `M` is a number denoting the major version.

The following example shows how to do this on the CLI using `git`.

.Creating new version branch `v1` using `git` on the CLI
====
[source,shell]
....
$ git checkout v0 <1>
$ git checkout -b v1 <2>
$ git push -u origin v1 <3>
....
<1> Checkout the revision you wish to start a new version from. Here we use the `HEAD` of the `v0` version branch.
<2> Create a new version branch with the major version incremented by `1` and switch to it.
<3> Set the remote tracking branch for the new branch.

== Creating a draft branch

.New draft branch `v1.new-logo`
====
// Mermaid Gitgraph
////
%%{init: { 'gitGraph': {'mainBranchName': 'v0', 'showBranches': true, 'parallelCommits': false}} }%%
gitGraph
  commit
  commit
  branch v1
  checkout v1
  commit

  branch v1.new-logo

Pick a version branch to branch the draft off of. Draft branches follow the naming convention: `vM.draft-name`, where `vM` is the name of the version branch, and `draft-name` is a name of the draft. It is recommended to choose a name that expresses the intent of the work done in the draft.

[NOTE]
It may seem like a good idea to also allow (or even prefer) draft branches to be based on releases, such as `v2.3.stakeholders-update`. However, you could wonder useful this really is. First of all, releases are tags, while it is more common and easier to branch off of a branch `HEAD`. Also, there's no real benefit, since often several drafts are being worked on for the same major version, and likely several of those are merged simultaneously leading to a new release.

$ git push -u origin v1.new-logo <3>
....
<1> Checkout the version branch you wish to start a new draft for. Here we use the `HEAD` of the `v1` version branch.
<2> Create a new draft branch and switch to it.
<3> Set the remote tracking branch for the new branch.
